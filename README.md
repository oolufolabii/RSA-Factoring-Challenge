# Tasks on RSA-Factoring-Challenge

1. Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.

2. RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n, there exist prime numbers p and q such that n = p Ã— q. The problem is to find these two primes, given only n.

    This task is the same as task 0, except:

* p and q are always prime numbers

* There is only one number in the files

## Constraints

* No language dependencies
* 5s max to complete calculations
* Required output format: n=p*q
